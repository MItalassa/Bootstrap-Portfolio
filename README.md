## Detailed page description

-I have divided my page in 3 big section: a personal profile section to present myself, a "My works" section that will represent the portfolio in itself and a "Contact me" section with all my contacts;
- the profile section includes a navbar (with link to go straight to my other section), and a jumbotron with a background photo, a personal photo and a short introductive paragraph;
